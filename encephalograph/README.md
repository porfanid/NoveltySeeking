# Encephalograph

This is a folder containing all the data reqired to connect the website with the encephalograph. After you download the project, you will compile and upload the `arduin.ino` file to the arduino. The website will do the rest.


If you need a 3.3V input, you can build the circuit as described in the fritzing design.
