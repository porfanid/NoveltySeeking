Each statement can be answered with the options <b>“no, not true,” “probably not true,” “partially true,” “probably true,” “yes, true”</b>. Read each statement and mark <u>which one applies most to you</u>. Answer <u>all</u> statements even if you are unsure of the answer. Read each statement carefully, but do not spend too much time deciding on an answer. There are no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answers; simply describe your <u>personal</u> opinions and feelings. If some statements seem similar to you, this is to describe yourself accurately. Try to describe yourself as you <u>usually or mostly</u> feel or act, not just how you feel at this moment.",
